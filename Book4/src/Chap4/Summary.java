    LinkedList Class
    
    - A linked list is a collection in which every object in the list maintains with it a
      pointer to the following object in the list and another pointer to the preceding
      object in the list
    
    - Linked lists require more memory than arrays and are slower
      than arrays when it comes to simple sequential access.
    
    Adding Items to a LinkedList
    
    - The LinkedList class gives you many ways to add items to the list. The most basic
      is the add method, which works pretty much the same way that it does for the
      ArrayList class.
    
     Example:
      LinkedList<String> officers = new LinkedList<String>();
      officers.add("Blake");
      officers.add("Burns");
      officers.add("Houlihan");
      officers.add("Pierce");
      officers.add("McIntyre");
     for (String s : officers)
     System.out.println(s);
     
    Retrieving Items from a LinkedList
    
    - As with the ArrayList class, you can use the get method to retrieve an item based
      on its index.
