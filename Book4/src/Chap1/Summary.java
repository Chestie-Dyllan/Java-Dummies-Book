    Working with Strings
    
    - Strings are reference types, not value types, such as int or boolean. As a
      result, a string variable holds a reference to an object created from the
      String class, not the value of the string itself.
    
     Exmpl: String line1 = "Oh what a beautiful morning!";
    
    - Strings can include escape sequences.
    
    Using the String Class
    
    - The String class is the class you use to create string objects.
    - A String object is immutable, which means that it canâ€™t be changed.
